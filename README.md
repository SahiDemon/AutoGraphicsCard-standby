# AutoGraphicsCard-standby
 When using laptops, if you're connected to an additional display through HDMI, all applications will run on your GPU instead of the CPU's integrated graphics memory. Even after disconnecting the HDMI port, the apps that ran on the GPU might continue to do so. To switch the graphics card back to standby mode, you'd usually have to manually close each of those apps. To simplify this process, a script is available that detects these applications and terminates them. This script automatically activates when you unplug the HDMI connection.
